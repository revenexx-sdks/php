     * `?unassigned_visibility=assigned_only` finds the channels that closed their

     * contains, prefix or range form — and the honoured set is exactly this
     * entity's 11 columns, because the generic list mount matches any query key
     * that names one. Each of them is declared as a query parameter with the
     * column's own CHECK behind it, so the 11 that work are the 11 the document
     * offers rather than a list a caller has to keep somewhere. An unknown column
     * is dropped rather than refused, so `?stauts=active` returns the unfiltered
     * page; `filter` echoes what was understood, which is the only way to catch
     * that. Paging is `limit`/`offset` over whatever survived the filters, and
     * `?order=` sorts by one column with an optional `.asc`/`.desc`; ask for no

     * them or who has since removed them. Calling it on a settled tenant is safe
     * and cheap for the same reason it is safe to fire on every install: it is
     * idempotent, keyed on the code, so a second call writes nothing. Everything
     * a merchant added themselves is left alone, and a row that already exists is
     * reported under `existing` rather than rewritten — the values you edited
     * on a seeded type survive this call. It RESTORES THE WHOLE SEED SET,

     * merchant removed on purpose from one they never had. Honouring the
     * retirement would mean inventing a tombstone rather than reading one. Given
     * that, restoring all 5 is the better half of the trade: this is the call a
     * tenant makes when something is missing, and a repair that silently skips
     * part of what it repairs, with no way to ask for the rest, is worse than one

     * DELETE, and is refused only if a channel has since started carrying it.

     * channel whose own code you deleted (only `shop` comes back), and it does
     * not restore the seeded VALUES of a type that still exists — a renamed
     * `storefront` stays renamed.
